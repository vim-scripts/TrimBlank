TrimBlank is a vim plugin aimed at helping trim trailing blank characters and
blank lines.

How to use this plugin?
Select some lines and type "<Leader>ttb"(<Leader> would be "backslash" by
default), then the trailing blank characters of the lines selected will be
trimmed; select some lines and type "<Leader>tbl", then the blank lines among
the lines selected will be trimmed; select some lines and type "<Leader>tab",
then both trailing blank characters and blank lines would be trimmed.
