OVERVIEW~
                                            *TrimBlank-overview*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TrimBlank is a vim plugin aimed at helping trim trailing blank characters and
blank lines.

How to use this plugin?
Select some lines and type "<Leader>ttb"(<Leader> would be "backslash" by
default), then the trailing blank characters of the lines selected will be
trimmed; select some lines and type "<Leader>tbl", then the blank lines among
the lines selected will be trimmed; select some lines and type "<Leader>tab",
then both trailing blank characters and blank lines would be trimmed.


INSTALLATION~
                                            *TrimBlank-installation*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Download the TrimBlank.zip file and extract it to your vim runtime
directory(~/.vim on linux and $VIM_INSTALLATION_FOLDER\vimfiles on
windows), you'd better then use helptags command to generate the help
tag(for example use ":helptags ~/.vim/doc" on Linux).

lines in visual mode.

<Leader>tbl ( Which stands for "Trim Blank Lines" )
Trim blank lines among the selected lines in visual mode.

<Leader>tab ( Which stands for "Trim All Blank" )

of the selected lines.


SETTINGS~
                                            *TrimBlank-settings*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            
                                            *TrimBlank-blank-characters*
If you want to custom the characters regarded as blank characters, put those
characters as a string in the varible "g:TrimBlank_BlankCharacters". For
example, if you want space and tab to be regarded as blank characters, add the
following line to your vimrc file:
>
 let g:TrimBlank_BlankCharacters = " \t"
<
Then TrimBlank will regard space and tab as blank characters. The default
value of g:TrimBlank_BlankCharacters is " \t".
